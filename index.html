    <p>According to a study conducted by Andreas Otto Josef Zabel et al., the turnover time for medical radiologist reporting at major hospitals takes on average 245 to 288 minutes.  This process is lengthy and costly. Our research intends to provide a supplementary solution to the problem by providing automatic x-ray annotation and reporting using a vision-language model. This research focuses on the annotation of chest x-rays using MIMIC data with a vision language model with an adapter architecture. The model takes x-ray images as inputs and outputs a short descriptive narrative of findings to assist radiologists in making diagnosis and reporting more efficient, effective and less burdensome. As an extension of the application of the model, we also develop an auto-completion tool as an assistive tool for radiologist to write x-ray reports effectively and efficiently.</p>
